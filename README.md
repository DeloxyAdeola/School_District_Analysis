These processes were carried out with all methods to make sure we have a clear analysis and making sure the data is suitable for analysis.

Analysis.
These are  high schools with grade 9,10,11,12. 
The Math_score average was 64.6 which may not be impressing compare to the to number of school. some factors  could some factors could be responsible for this mean score which i believe the school board should look into. 
minimum reading score is 10.5 which is also not ideal. 

As requested by Maria based of school budgets, The average budget for public school is 911195.5 while that of Charter school is 872625.6 The average budget for public school is higher than that of the Charter school. This could be as a result of the acceptance rate to public school than that of Charter due to the prerequiste.

Charter school exceeds the public school in math performance.especially the 9graders in Charter school.

Montgomery High School has the highest number of students while Chang High School has the lowest.

In conclusion, the overall performance of both schools types is not too impressive and the budget for Public school is higher than that of Charter school.
